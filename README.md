# Median Calculator Project

This is my implementation of a program that calculates the median from numbers in a CSV file. 

## Features
- Reads numbers from a CSV file 
- Calculates the median value 
- Handles both odd and even number of values
- Error handling for file operations and empty datasets

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
2. Run the executable
3. Enter the name of your CSV file when prompted
4. The program will output the median value!

## Implementation Details
- Used modern C++ features like smart pointers
- Implemented error handling with try-catch blocks
- Follows good coding practices with separate functions for different tasks

## Note
This is a project for my programming class. The code demonstrates working with files, vectors, and mathematical calculations in C++.
